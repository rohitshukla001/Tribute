            <h3>What is Bhagat singh?</h3>
            <p>Bhagat Singh (September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in
                the murder of a junior British police officer and an Indian head constable in mistaken retaliation for
                the death of an Indian nationalist. He also took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central
                Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in
                Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in Punjab region, and after his execution at
                age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.
            </p>
            <p>Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s,
                and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually
                successful campaign for India's independence.
                In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary
                group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
                British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan,
            </p>
            <p>mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James
                Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular
                Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was
                injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a
                motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a
                marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem
                report showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an
                Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.
            </p>
            <p>After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging
                Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their
                intended target instead of James Scott. Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no
                convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate,
                Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two low-intensity homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the Central
                Legislative Assembly in Delhi.
                They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and allowed the
                authorities to arrest them.
            </p>
            <p>The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case.
                Awaiting trial, Singh gained
                public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison
                conditions for Indian prisoners,
                the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in September 1929.
                Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931,
                aged 23. He became a popular folk
                hero after his death.

            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab
                in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and
                three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his
                uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal
                Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.
                After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, </p>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore. In 1923, he joined the National
                College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's
                non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the
                British Indian government.
            </p>
            <p>Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext
                that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released
                on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi
                newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan
                Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British. He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party
                ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.He often
                used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi</p>
