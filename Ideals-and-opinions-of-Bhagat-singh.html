            <h2>Ideals and opinions of Bhagat singh?
            </h2>
            <h3>Communism</h3>
            <p>Singh regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, the founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero. Bhagat was also
                inspired by Bhai Parmanand,
                another founding-member of the Ghadar Party. Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism. He was an
                avid reader
                of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. In his
                last testament,
                "To Young Political Workers", he declares his ideal as the "Social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist,
                basis".
                Singh did not believe in the Gandhian ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of
                non-violent resistance,
                and felt that such politics would replace one set of exploiters with another.</p>

            <p>From May to September 1928, Singh published a series of articles on anarchism in Kirti. He was concerned
                that the public
                misunderstood the concept of anarchism, writing that: "The people are scared of the word anarchism. The
                word anarchism
                has been abused so much that even in India revolutionaries have been called anarchist to make them
                unpopular." He clarified
                that anarchism refers to the absence of a ruler and abolition of the state, not the absence of order. He
                went on to say:
                "I think in India the idea of universal brotherhood, the Sanskrit sentence Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam etc.,
                has the same meaning." He believed that:
                The ultimate goal of Anarchism is complete independence, according to which no one will be obsessed with
                God or religion,
                nor will anybody be crazy for money or other worldly desires. There will be no chains on the body or
                control by the state.
                This means that they want to eliminate: the Church, God and Religion; the state; Private property.</p>

            <p>On 21 January 1930, during the trial of the Lahore Conspiracy Case, Bhagat Singh and his HSRA comrades,
                appeared in the
                court wearing red scarves. When the magistrate took his chair, they raised slogans "Long Live Socialist
                Revolution",
                "Long Live Communist International", "Long Live People" "Lenin's Name Will Never Die", and "Down with
                Imperialism".
                Bhagat Singh then read the text of a telegram in the court and asked the magistrate to send it to the
                Third
                International. The telegram stated:</p>
            <p>"On Lenin day we send harty greetings to all who are doing something for carrying forward the ideas of
                the great
                Lenin. We wish success to the great experiment Russia is carrying out. We join our voice to that of the
                international
                working class movement. The proletariat will win. Capitalism will be defeated. Death to Imperialism".
            </p>

            <p>Historian K. N. Panikkar described Singh as one of the early Marxists in India.[86] The political
                theorist Jason
                Adams notes that he was more enamoured with Lenin than with Marx. From 1926 onward, he studied the
                history of
                the revolutionary movements in India and abroad. In his prison notebooks, he quoted Lenin in reference
                to imperialism
                and capitalism and also the revolutionary thoughts of Trotsky.

                On the day his execution, Bhagat Singh was reading the book, Reminiscences of Lenin, authored by Clara
                Zetkin, a
                German Marxist.When asked what his last wish was, Singh replied that he was studying the life of Lenin
                and he wanted to finish it before his death.</p>

            <h3>Atheism</h3>
            <p>Singh began to question religious ideologies after witnessing the Hindu–Muslim riots that broke out after
                Gandhi
                disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement. He did not understand how members of these two groups, initially
                united
                in fighting against the British, could be at each other's throats because of their religious
                differences.[91]
                At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs, since he believed religion hindered the
                revolutionaries'
                struggle for independence, and began studying the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky – all atheist
                revolutionaries.
                He also took an interest in Soham Swami's book Common Sense.

                While in prison in 1930–31, Bhagat Singh was approached by Randhir Singh, a fellow inmate, and a Sikh
                leader
                who would later found the Akhand Kirtani Jatha. According to Bhagat Singh's close associate Shiva Verma,
                who later compiled and edited his writings, Randhir Singh tried to convince Bhagat Singh of the
                existence
                of God, and upon failing berated him:</p>
            <p> "You are giddy with fame and have developed an ego that is standing
                like a black curtain between you and God". In response, Bhagat Singh wrote an essay entitled
                "Why I Am an Atheist" to address the question of whether his atheism was born out of vanity.
                In the essay, he defended his own beliefs and said that he used to be a firm believer in the
                Almighty, but could not bring himself to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to
                their hearts.[95] He acknowledged the fact that religion made death easier, but also said that
                unproven philosophy is a sign of human weakness. In this context, he noted:</p>
            <p>

                As regard the origin of God, my thought is that man created God in his imagination when he realised
                his weaknesses, limitations and shortcomings. In this way he got the courage to face all the trying
                circumstances and to meet all dangers that might occur in his life and also to restrain his outbursts
                in prosperity and affluence. God, with his whimsical laws and parental generosity was painted with
                variegated colours of imagination. He was used as a deterrent factor when his fury and his laws were
                repeatedly propagated so that man might not become a danger to society. He was the cry of the distressed
                soul for he was believed to stand as father and mother, sister and brother, brother and friend when in
                time of distress a man was left alone and helpless. He was Almighty and could do anything. </p>
            <p>
                The idea of God is helpful to a man in distress.

                Towards the end of the essay, Bhagat Singh wrote:

                Let us see how steadfast I am. One of my friends asked me to pray. When informed of my atheism,
                he said, "When your last days come, you will begin to believe." I said, "No, dear sir, Never shall
                it happen. I consider it to be an act of degradation and demoralisation. For such petty selfish motives,
                I shall never pray." Reader and friends, is it vanity? If it is, I stand for it.</p>

            <h3>"Killing the ideas"</h3>
            <p>In the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 8 April 1929, he stated: "It is easy to
                kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived.
                "[96] While in prison, Singh and two others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked
                to be treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing squad and not by hanging.
                [97] Prannath Mehta, Singh's friend, visited him in the jail on 20 March, three days before his
                execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it.</p>
