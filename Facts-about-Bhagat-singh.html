            <h3>Facts about Bhagat singh? </h3>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was born on 28 September 1907. He was also known as Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh. He is one
                of
                the youngest freedom fighters who was hanged at a young age. In this article, we are presenting some
                unknown
                facts about Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary life which not only inspires but also influences others.
            <p>
            <p>Bhagat Singh is considered one of the most powerful revolutionaries of Indian Independence movement. He
                inspired thousands to take up the cause of the freedom movement.

                He was a brave freedom fighter. His feelings of patriotism were not only restricted against British rule
                but also towards the division of India on communal lines. He was genius, mature, and always attracted to
                socialism.</p>
            <p><b>1.</b> Bhagat Singh was so much disturbed by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that he bunked the school
                to visit
                the site of the bloodbath. In college, he was a great actor and played several roles in plays like ‘Rana
                Pratap’ and ‘Bharat-Durdasha’.</p>
            <p><b>2.</b> Bhagat Singh in his childhood always spoke about guns. He wanted to grow guns in the fields
                using
                which he can fight with the British. When he was 8 years old, instead of talking about toys or games he
                always speaks about driving out British from India.
            </p>
            <p><b>3.</b> When Bhagat Singh's parents wanted him to marry, he ran away to Kanpur. He told his parents
                that "if I
                will marry in colonial India, where British Raj is there, then my bride will be my death. Therefore,
                there is no rest or worldly desire that can lure me now’. Then, after this, he joined the "Hindustan
                Socialist Republican Association".
            </p>
            <p><b>4.</b> He was attracted to socialism and socialist revolutions led by Lenin at an early age and
                started
                reading about them. Bhagat Singh said ‘They may kill me, but not my ideas. They can crush my body, but
                will not be able to crush my spirit’.
            </p>
            <p><b>5. </b>Bhagat Singh had told the British that "instead of hanging they should shoot him" but the
                British did
                not consider it. He mentioned this in his last letter. Bhagat Singh wrote in this letter, "Since I was
                arrested during the war. Therefore, I cannot be punished for hanging. Let me be thrown into the mouth of
                a cannon. "This shows his braveness and the feeling for the nation.
            </p>
            <p><b>6.</b> </b>Along with the associates, Bhagat Singh threw bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly.
                They don’t
                want to injure anyone. The bombs were made of low-grade explosives.

            </p>
            <p><b>7.</b> He went on a hunger strike during his stay in jail. It is surprising that during this time he
                used to
                do all his work regularly, such as singing, reading writing books, visiting court every day, etc.

            </p>
            <p><b>8.</b> Bhagat Singh coined a powerful slogan ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ which became the slogan of India’s
                armed
                struggle.

            </p>
            <p><b>9.</b> He was hanged an hour ahead of the official time on March 23, 1931. It is said that Bhagat
                Singh was
                smiling when he was hanged. In fact, this was done with a fearlessness to "lowered British imperialism".

            </p>
            <p><b>10.</b> When his mother had come to visit him in jail, Bhagat Singh was laughing loudly. Seeing this,
                the
                jail officials were shocked to see how this person is who is laughing openly despite being so close to
                death.

            </p>
            <p><b>11.</b> His legacy will continue to live in the hearts of many. These unknown facts will surely pave deep respect
                and also gives an idea about his life and its revolution.

            </p>
            <p ><b>12.</b> He along with Sukhdev planned to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai and plotted to kill the Superintendent of Police James Scott in Lahore. However, in a case of mistaken identity, John Saunders, the Assistant Superintendent of Police was shot.
            </p>
            <p><b>13.</b> Bhagat Singh left home for Kanpur when his parents tried to get him married, saying that if he married in slave India, “my bride shall only be death” and joined Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.

            </p>
            <p><b>14.</b> Although a Sikh by birth, he shaved his beard and cut his hair to avoid being recognised and arrested for the killing. He managed to escape from Lahore to Calcutta.

            </p>
            <p><b>15.</b> A year later, he and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs in the Central Assembly Hall in Delhi, and shouted “Inquilab Zindabad!” He did not resist his arrest at this point.

            </p>
            <p><b>16.</b> During interrogation, the British came to know about his involvement in the death of John Saunders a year earlier.

            </p>
            <p><b>17.</b> At the time of his trial, he didn’t offer any defence, rather used the occasion to propagate the idea of India’s freedom.

            </p>
            <p><b>18.</b> During his stay in jail, he went on a hunger strike against the policy of better treatment for prisoners of foreign origin.
