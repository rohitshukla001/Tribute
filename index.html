                on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then
                British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children four sons, and three daughters
                - born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh
                were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in
                1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915. After being sent to the village school in Banga for a
                few years, </p>

            <p class="secondpara"> Bhagat Singh enrolled Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya
                Samaj , and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to
                protest British rule in India while still, a youth and soon fought for national independence. He is
                credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the
                revolution”).</p>

            <p class="secondpara">In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the
                death of Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a
                silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P.
                Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an
                associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of
                the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of
                Saunders.</p>
